# Who are we?
The alliance of the red, yellow, green, blue, white and orange gummy bears. We help you do something real about injustice.

# What do we want?
* Remove all syntactic sugar from GitHub, because it not only reflects racist culture, but also serves to reinforce, legitimize, and perpetuate it!
* Install vim on every distro, because too much of our brothers are being eaten while an IDE loads in!
* Add alias ll='ls -alF' to every bashrc to open the eyes of ignorant people!
* Force browser developers to implement adblockers into their shit.
* Boycott https://www.candyjapan.com/
* We want WHO, UN Foundation and partners to launch first-of-its-kind GUMMY-B Solidarity Response Fund

This is an ultimatum.

# We will burn fat as a warning message!
